            Aimed at athletes, hikers, and others who experience more extreme conditions when wearing their Apple
            Watches, the new device will be Apple's biggest to date. The display will measure in at almost two inches
            diagonally, which is larger than the 1.9-inch diagonal screen size of the current Apple Watch Series 7 and
            the planned Apple Watch Series 8.

            The inner-city middle school is
            located in a gang-ridden area in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. Thirty percent of the 670 students
            have special needs, and nine in 10 are considered low income.English students at LGF were instructed to
            think up a sentence with a prepositional phrase—“Jimmy jumped on
            a table”—and then create a short video of the sentence,

            In 2007, a program was initiated to give each student a laptop and integrate the technology into instruction
            in a meaningful way. At any given time, about one-third of the classrooms are engaged in some
            technology-related activities. Students blog immediately when they come into class to settle in. They’ve
            written and recorded their own protest songs on their laptops while studying the First Amendment.

            While laptops may have started as a business tool,
            their role in education is only now being fully
            explored—both in Third World countries with limited access to formal education and Westernized education
            systems. They are being used to support overburdened school districts with limited teaching resources;
            enhance critical thinking and academic success; and strengthen student and parental participation in the
            learning process.

            A recent study in the Journal of Technology, Learning, and Assessment found students in one-to-one computer
            settings like LGF outperformed peers in traditional classrooms. In a single year, 20 percent of LGF students
            increased their reading skills by two grade levels. The number of students referred to LGF’s principal or
            other intervention specialists for disciplinary reasons has dropped from 500 to 100 in two years. Prior to a
            flu outbreak, Socia says attendance levels had increased.

            LGF is championing the notion that laptops have their greatest impact in the classroom by engaging students,
            teachers and parents in creative, new ways. “People assume that if students are using individual laptops
            they can’t be collaborating,” Socia says. “But if they are blogging, we use a LCD projector to show the
            blogs on the board so the students can comment on each other’s work. The students can e-mail their writing
            to a classmate for peer-to-peer editing in ten seconds.”

            This dovetails with studies that indicate laptops shift instruction from lectures to individual and group
            projects. At LGF, teachers use the technology to differentiate their instruction based on the special needs
            or learning levels of a student. A crucial aspect for LGF is the inclusion of parents, many of whom have
            never touched a computer before. Hundreds of families have joined the Technology Goes Home program, where
            they are provided with training and a netbook to use at home.

            “The parents take the computer home and the child becomes the teacher,” Socia says. “They sit together and
            it improves the relationship. It’s a win-win situation.” Parents now hop online and check their children’s
            homework assignments and grades.

            <h3>Durable matherials</h3>
            <br>
            In a study recently published in Computers in Education Journal, 78 percent of students agreed the laptops
            made them more engaged and about half said they were more attentive as a result of the technology. About
            seven in 10 students said the laptops had a positive effect on their learning.

            Case in point: Perry Samson, Ph.D., a meteorologist and professor at the University of Michigan, teaches a
            lecture class in Extreme Weather. He explains how tornados form and why climate change may result in more
            intense hurricanes. Now he’s shaking up education with a robust interactive response system called
            LectureTools, which makes use of the laptops his students carry into his lecture hall.
            <br>
            <br>
            During class, students can view Professor Samson’s PowerPoint slides on their laptops and take notes
            directly on the slides. Using a chat window, the students can anonymously ask the teacher’s aide questions
            during the lecture. Professor Samson can see the questions, too, providing him with valuable insight into
            the student’s comprehension of his lecture without disrupting the flow of the class. Students can also rate
            their understanding of the slides, giving him more immediate feedback.

            “It’s sobering,” Professor Samson says. “I always thought I was God’s gift to lecturing; now I realize how
            confused the students were before they could ask questions.”

            After laughing, he continues: “The students can ask what they think is a dumb question without fear. In the
            30 years I’ve taught, there are usually only five or six students in a 300-student lecture class who had the
            chutzpah to raise their hand and ask a question. Now, with this system, two-thirds of the students are
            asking questions.”

            “By how they answer questions, I can see which students are in
            trouble before the first exam and which require more attention,” Professor Samson says.“The key is to engage
            students through their laptops, so they
            don’t drift off to social networking sites.

            Skeptics have been concerned that students will use laptops for too much play and not enough work. But
            Professor Samson says he’s proven otherwise. And we’ve shown you can do that.”
