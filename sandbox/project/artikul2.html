        <h2>Coffe is the new trend</h2>

        <div class="article">
            <br>The National Coffee Association (NCA) report on American coffee consumption in 2017 shows we are one
            very
            caffeinated nation. This might not come as a shock—Starbucks and other coffee chains, along with local
            coffee shops, are staples in nearly every city in America—but what is surprising is the type of coffee we’re
            drinking. According to the NCA report on National Coffee Drinking Trends, 59% of coffee consumed daily is
            classified as “gourmet.” This is the first time in the trend report’s 67-year history that more than half of
            daily consumption falls into this specialized category. Younger people are driving this growth and in coffee
            consumption outside of the home; people 65 years and older drink most of their coffee at home, while coffee
            drinkers under the age of 35 are more likely to drink it on the go.<img src="obrazky/kafe.jpg" alt=""

            The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) broke the NCA numbers down even further to create the infographic
            above. Some notable findings:
            46% of coffee was consumed outside of the home in 2017. Of all the coffee consumed, 59% was specialty versus
            41% non-specialty.
            Over the last 18 years, the number of daily
            specialty drinkers has seen the strongest overall growth in the
            coffee market. Only 9% of U.S. adults were drinking specialty coffee daily in 1999. In 2017, that number hit
            41%.

            Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren’t thinking about its
            health benefits or risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 coffee
            was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated,
            as research found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary,
            there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history
            was properly accounted for. Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in moderation,
            coffee can be considered a healthy beverage. Why then in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that
            coffee must bear a cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.

            Coffee is an intricate mixture of more than a thousand chemicals. [1] The cup of coffee you order from a
            coffee shop is likely different from the coffee you brew at home. What defines a cup is the type of coffee
            bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of grind, and how it is brewed. Human response to coffee or
            caffeine can also vary substantially across individuals. Low to moderate doses of caffeine (50–300 mg) may
            cause increased alertness, energy, and ability to concentrate, while higher doses may have negative effects
            such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate. [2] Still, the cumulative research on
            coffee points in the direction of a health benefit. [3,4] Does the benefit stem from the caffeine or plant
            compounds in the coffee bean? Is there a certain amount of coffee needed a day to produce a health
            benefit?
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Did you know?</h3>
            <br>

            It is a myth that darker roasts contain a higher level of caffeine than lighter roasts. Lighter roasts
            actually have a slightly higher concentration!
            Coffee grinds should not be brewed more than once. Brewed grinds taste bitter and may no longer produce a
            pleasant coffee flavor.
            While water is always the best choice for quenching your thirst, coffee can count towards your daily fluid
            goals. Although caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, it is offset by the total amount of fluid from the
            coffee.<br><br>
