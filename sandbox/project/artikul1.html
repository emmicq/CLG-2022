        <h2>Panama Canal - Waterway between the Atlantic and the Pacific</h2>

        <div class="article">
            <br>The Panama Canal is a waterway that connects the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. Before the canal was
            opened
            in 1914 ships had to travel around the southern tip of South America to get from the Atlantic to the Pacific
            Ocean. The Panama Canal shortens the journey by about 11000 km.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Panama Canal is 82 km long. Ships travel through the waterway through a system of locks. Panama is a
            hilly country and it was not possible to build a sea-level canal. Instead ships must pass through chambers
            that are filled with water. They raise and lower ships from one level of the canal to another. Each of the
            locks is about 300 meters long. Ships cannot travel through the locks by themselves. They are connected to
            cables and pulled by trains that move alongside the canal. There is always a pair of locks so that ships can
            travel in both directions. When a ship enters the canal a special canal pilot comes on board and guides the
            ship through the canal safely. It takes a ship about 8 to 10 hours to travel through the Panama Canal.

            <h3>History of the Panama Canal</h3>
            <br>
            People have dreamed of connecting the two oceans for a long time. In the 1880s Ferdinand de Lesseps, a
            French engineer who had built the Suez Canal a few years before, attempted to build a canal through Panama
            by digging straight through the hills but the project failed.

            In 1903 Panama became an independent country and allowed the United States to build a canal on its
            territory. The two countries signed a treaty which not only gave the Americans the right to control the
            canal but also gave them land on which the canal was built. The Americans decided to build a canal that
            depended on locks because they thought it would be cheaper and easier to build. It took about 10 years to
            build the Panama Canal and up to 40,000 men worked on the project.
            <br><br>
            Even though diseases like yellow fever and malaria could already be cured at that time, thousand s of
            workers died in the jungle of Panama. In 1914 construction ended and the canal was officially opened.

            The Canal Zone became a kind of American colony and led to many problems between America and Panama in the
            20th century. Many citizens of Panama did not want the Americans in their country. In 1977 the United States
            and Panama signed a new agreement and on December 31, 1999 the USA handed the Canal Zone over to the
            Panamanian government. Today, Panama operates the canal but the United States still has the right to defend
            it in times of war.

            The Panama Canal is very important for the worldâ€™s economy. About 12,000 ships and 200 million tons of goods
            pass through the canal every year. However, the canal has become too small and big freighters and
            supertankers cannot travel through it. Panama and the United States are planning to make the canal bigger so
            that larger ships can pass through.
