        <h2>Boaty McBoatface’s new mission is more serious than its name</h2>
        <hr>
        <hr>
        <div class="article">
            The submersible is accompanied by other underwater robots as it heads off into the cold, dark underbelly of
            the Thwaites Glacier.

            Boaty McBoatface, the comically named autonomous submarine courtesy of a collective internet joke, will be
            among a fleet of underwater robots dispatched to the underbelly of the deteriorating Thwaites glacier in
            Western Antarctica.<br>

            A recent study in the Journal of Technology, Learning, and Assessment found students in one-to-one computer
            settings like LGF outperformed peers in traditional classrooms. In a single year, 20 percent of LGF students
            increased their reading skills by two grade levels. The number of students referred to LGF’s principal or
            other intervention specialists for disciplinary reasons has dropped from 500 to 100 in two years. Prior to a
            flu outbreak, Socia says attendance levels had increased.

            LGF is championing the notion that laptops have their greatest impact in the classroom by engaging students,
            teachers and parents in creative, new ways. “People assume that if students are using individual laptops
            they can’t be collaborating,” Socia says. “But if they are blogging, we use a LCD projector to show the
            blogs on the board so the students can comment on each other’s work. The students can e-mail their writing
            to a classmate for peer-to-peer editing in ten seconds.”

            This dovetails with studies that indicate laptops shift instruction from lectures to individual and group
            projects. At LGF, teachers use the technology to differentiate their instruction based on the special needs
            or learning levels of a student. A crucial aspect for LGF is the inclusion of parents, many of whom have
            never touched a computer before. Hundreds of families have joined the Technology Goes Home program, where
            they are provided with training and a netbook to use at home.

            “The parents take the computer home and the child becomes the teacher,” Socia says. “They sit together and
            it improves the relationship. It’s a win-win situation.” Parents now hop online and check their children’s
            homework assignments and grades.

            <h3>Taking College by Storm</h3>
            <br>
            In a study recently published in Computers in Education Journal, 78 percent of students agreed the laptops
            made them more engaged and about half said they were more attentive as a result of the technology. About
            seven in 10 students said the laptops had a positive effect on their learning.

            Case in point: Perry Samson, Ph.D., a meteorologist and professor at the University of Michigan, teaches a
            lecture class in Extreme Weather. He explains how tornados form and why climate change may result in more
            intense hurricanes. Now he’s shaking up education with a robust interactive response system called
            LectureTools, which makes use of the laptops his students carry into his lecture hall.
            <br>
            <br>
            During class, students can view Professor Samson’s PowerPoint slides on their laptops and take notes
            directly on the slides. Using a chat window, the students can anonymously ask the teacher’s aide questions
            during the lecture. Professor Samson can see the questions, too, providing him with valuable insight into
            the student’s comprehension of his lecture without disrupting the flow of the class. Students can also rate
            their understanding of the slides, giving him more immediate feedback.

            “It’s sobering,” Professor Samson says. “I always thought I was God’s gift to lecturing; now I realize how
            confused the students were before they could ask questions.”

            After laughing, he continues: “The students can ask what they think is a dumb question without fear. In the
            30 years I’ve taught, there are usually only five or six students in a 300-student lecture class who had the
            chutzpah to raise their hand and ask a question. Now, with this system, two-thirds of the students are
            asking questions.”

            During class, students can use their laptops to answer multiple-choice questions and image-based questions,
            such as locating weather patterns on a map. “By how they answer questions, I can see which students are in
            trouble before the first exam and which require more attention,” Professor Samson says.

            Skeptics have been concerned that students will use laptops for too much play and not enough work. But
            Professor Samson says he’s proven otherwise. “The key is to engage students through their laptops, so they
            don’t drift off to social networking sites. And we’ve shown you can do that.”
