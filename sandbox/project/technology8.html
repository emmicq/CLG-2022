        <h2>Your Address and Other Personal Info Are a Search Away. Here’s What to Do About It. </h2>
        <hr>

            Data that personally identifies you can pop up on Google and other sites, but with some basic steps and a
            little persistence, you can hide or remove a lot of it.
            When you type your name into a search engine, you typically expect to see links to your social-media
            profiles or personal websites. <br><br>But you might also find your home address, email, phone number, the
            names of
            relatives and more.
            Back in early 2019 a small team of people from Cambridge Assessment and Judge Business School had already
            been thinking about how we design and deliver education, and whether it was fit for purpose. The question we
            were asking ourselves was:

            Is education continuing to meet the needs of young people, and preparing them for the type of world they
            will face when they leave school?
            <img src="obrazky/hacker.jpg" alt="" class="image">
            <br><br>
            While laptops may have started as a business tool,
            their role in education is only now being fully
            explored—both in Third World countries with limited access to formal education and Westernized education
            systems. They are being used to support overburdened school districts with limited teaching resources;
            enhance critical thinking and academic success; and strengthen student and parental participation in the
            learning process.

            <br>A recent study in the Journal of Technology, Learning, and Assessment found students in one-to-one
            computer
            settings like LGF outperformed peers in traditional classrooms. In a single year, 20 percent of LGF students
            increased their reading skills by two grade levels. The number of students referred to LGF’s principal or
            other intervention specialists for disciplinary reasons has dropped from 500 to 100 in two years. Prior to a
            flu outbreak, Socia says attendance levels had increased.

            LGF is championing the notion that laptops have their greatest impact in the classroom by engaging students,
            teachers and parents in creative, new ways. “People assume that if students are using individual laptops
            they can’t be collaborating,” Socia says. <br><br>“But if they are blogging, we use a LCD projector to show
            the
            blogs on the board so the students can comment on each other’s work. The students can e-mail their writing
            to a classmate for peer-to-peer editing in ten seconds.”

            This dovetails with studies that indicate laptops shift instruction from lectures to individual and group
            projects. At LGF, teachers use the technology to differentiate their instruction based on the special needs
            or learning levels of a student. A crucial aspect for LGF is the inclusion of parents, many of whom have
            never touched a computer before. Hundreds of families have joined the Technology Goes Home program, where
            they are provided with training and a netbook to use at home.

            “The parents take the computer home and the child becomes the teacher,” Socia says. “They sit together and
            it improves the relationship. It’s a win-win situation.” Parents now hop online and check their children’s
            homework assignments and grades.

            <h3>What we can do about the problem</h3>
            <br>

            As well as reading all the research, the team in Cambridge was also going to lots of education conferences.
            We noticed that there were ‘siloes’ of activity at these conferences.
            <br><img src="obrazky/antivirus.jpg" alt="" class="image">
            This meant that there would be a conference for teachers, where only teachers talked to each other. And
            conferences for policy people, where only policy people talked to each other. And research conferences for
            research people. And so on.

            What we also noticed was that entrepreneurs, start-ups and innovation teams did things differently.
            Fundamentally, they looked outside their own worlds. They built things in a cross-functional, iterative way.
            So we asked ourselves:

            Could we borrow that model and apply it to education?
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>The start of SHAPE Education</h3>
            <br>
            We wanted to do more than just ask questions and talk about problems. We wanted to do something. And so we
            started SHAPE Education.

            We realised it’s not practical or sensible to try and change something as complex as education from the top
            down. In the same way as entrepreneurs and start-ups, the approach which has a realistic chance of bringing
            successful change is to:

            start with properly understanding where the issues and problems are
            form some ideas and hypothesis about how to address them
            build a coalition, or community, of people who want to be involved in those changes
            run some experiments
            make some things happen.

            <br><br>This idea of creating a process of discovery, and ‘learning as you go’, is how change happens in
            society,
            and we know we can apply that to education.

            Our aim was to:

            find a way that Cambridge could adopt this approach to solving the problems in education
            make this approach a cross-functional, collaborative, iterative way of working, meaning that teachers work
            alongside, for example, tech developers, researchers, learners, etc.

            <br><br>
            If you agree with this approach and you want to be part of SHAPE Education, then please visit
            shape-education.org to sign up to our mailing list and see how you can get involved in helping make
            education more connected to your community. We’d love you to join us. Together we can tackle this challenge.
