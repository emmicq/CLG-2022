        <h2>Chess robot breaks seven-year-old boy's finger during Moscow Open</h2>

            A robot broke a seven-year-old boy's finger during a chess match in Moscow last week, Russian news outlets
            report.

            "The robot broke the child's finger," Sergey Lazarev, Moscow Chess Federation President, told Tass news
            agency. "This is of course bad."<br><br>

            A video shared on social media shows the robot taking one of the boy's pieces. The boy then makes his own
            move, and the robot grabs his finger.

            Four adults rush to help the boy, who is eventually freed and ushered away.

            Mr Lazarev said the machine had played many previous matches without incident.

            The boy was able to finish the final days of the tournament in a cast, Tass reports.

            Case in point: Perry Samson, Ph.D., a meteorologist and professor at the University of Michigan, teaches a
            lecture class in Extreme Weather. He explains how tornados form and why climate change may result in more
            intense hurricanes. Now he’s shaking up education with a robust interactive response system called
            LectureTools, which makes use of the laptops his students carry into his lecture hall.

            But they haven’t adequately managed to predict how proteins fold from scratch. Before deep learning came
            along, the protein-folding problem seemed impossibly hard, and it seemed poised to frustrate computational
            chemists for many decades to come. AlphaZero didn’t learn anything from humans or chess games played by
            humans. It taught itself and, in the process, derived strategies never seen before. In a commentary in
            Science magazine, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov wrote that by learning from playing itself,
            AlphaZero developed strategies that “reflect the truth” of chess rather than reflecting “the priorities and
            prejudices” of the programmers. “It’s the embodiment of the cliché ‘work smarter, not harder.’” In the
            competition, teams are given the linear sequence of amino acids for about 100 proteins for which the 3D
            shape is known but hasn’t yet been published; they then have to compute how these sequences would fold. In
            2018 AlphaFold, the deep-learning rookie at the competition, beat all the traditional programs – but
            barely.<br>
            As with the chess and Go programs – AlphaZero and AlphaGo – we don’t exactly know what the AlphaFold2
            algorithm is doing and why it uses certain correlations, but we do know that it works.

            Besides helping us predict the structures of important proteins, understanding AlphaFold’s “thinking” will
            also help us gain new insights into the mechanism of protein folding.
